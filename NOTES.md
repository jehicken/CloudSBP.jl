* Increasing the stencil size generally improves the conditioning of the Vandermonde matrix.  This also helps the optimization problem, as it becomes easier to solve.  For example for degree=5, I tried using n* + degree and n* + 2*degree nodes in the stencil, and the former needed 87 iterations (on the last opt) and the latter needed 22 iterations.  So, it is a tradeoff between the difficulty of finding an operator, and having an operator with a small stencil.

* Furthermore, it is a good idea to include more than the minimum number of nodes in the stencil, because as the optimization progresses, the Vandermonde matrix for a cell can become large if the stencil is not sufficiently large; that is, the stencil size guards against future changes to the node locations and improves robustness.

* What can be said regarding existence?  If the number of nodes can be related to a element-based mesh, perhaps we can say there exists a quadrature, but the process we use to find the quadrature (that is, using cell) may make it unreachable.
