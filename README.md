This Julia package is a research code for constructing summation-by-parts (SBP) finite-difference operators on point clouds over complex geometries.  It is the library that implements the algorithm and produced the results in the following paper:

> Jason Hicken, Ge Yan, and Sharanjeet Kaur, ``Constructing stable, high-order finite-difference operators on point clouds over complex geometries,'' under review.

We are working toward registering the package, but, in the meantime, you will have the follow the instructions [here](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/managing-packages/#Adding-unregistered-packages) in order to use it.
